# Part 8 - Observable and Observer and debugging


In this task, you will be given two Java classes, [`FlightStatus`](./FlightStatus.java) and [`FlightStatusObserverImpl`](./FlightStatusObserverImpl.java), which are part of the airline system. Your goal is to identify and fix two bugs present in the implementation of these classes. The FlightStatus class is responsible for managing the status of a flight, and the FlightStatusObserverImpl class is an implementation of the FlightStatusObserver interface that receives updates on flight status changes.

Your task is to:

1. Identify the two bugs in the implementation of the FlightStatus and FlightStatusObserverImpl classes.
2. Fix the bugs by writing the correct code according to the JavaDocs.
